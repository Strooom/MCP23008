# MCP23008 Driver

This driver has the following (extra) features :
* it can detect at which address the MCP23008 is present. Multiple MCP23008 can be detected. They can have I2C address 0x20 to 0x27 by configuring HW pins A0..A2
* it keeps a shadow copy of the MCP23008 registers in RAM, allowing to :
    * detect a corrupt device config (some internal bits changed due to EMC or whatever HW problem)
    * refresh the device configuration regularly


* The target unit tests expect some specific HW configuration in order to pass:
    * I2C address is 0x21
    * there is a HW loopback from GPIO3 (out) to GPIO6 (in)
